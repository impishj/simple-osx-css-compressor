simple-osx-css-compressor
=========================

Manas Tungare's css compressor in the form of a simple osx app that you drag your files onto and copy your compressed code from.

Manas Tungare's original file ( https://gist.github.com/2625128 ) which if you have lots of css files your deploying is probably the way to go. 

This was mostly made because textmate's built in css compressor does not remove comments, and was easy to make.

Someday if I have time I'll make this accept multiple files. and write the files locally If that sort of thing will work in platypus which I think it will.
